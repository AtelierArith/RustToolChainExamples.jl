# calcpi-rs

A Rust library for calculating π (pi) using the Monte Carlo method.

## Overview

This library estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method. It calculates π from the probability that randomly generated points fall within a unit circle.

## Building

### Standard Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### C Header File Generation

The C header file (`include/calcpi.h`) is automatically generated by `cbindgen` during the build process.

## Output Files

After building, the following files are generated:

- **Library files**:
  - Linux: `target/release/libcalcpi_rs.so`
  - macOS: `target/release/libcalcpi_rs.dylib`
  - Windows: `target/release/calcpi_rs.dll`

- **C header file**: `include/calcpi.h`

## Library Types

This project generates the following three library types:

- `cdylib` - C-compatible dynamic library (used for calling from Julia)
- `staticlib` - Static library
- `rlib` - Rust library

## Dependencies

- `rand = "0.8"` - Random number generation
- `cbindgen = "0.29"` - C header file generation (build-time only)

## Integration with Julia Package

This library is used by the `CalcPi.jl` package. For details, see `../CalcPi.jl/README.md`.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```
